_Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: I cleaned up my code by making the function parameters default values rather than hard-coded values to make the functions more reusable. I also fixed/added the docstrings to all of my functions.

Summary of function(s) added: The function I added (title()) adds a title to the top of the graph using the turtle's write function. It also increases the size of the screen to separate the graph from the title.

Summary of Feature Added: Similar to above, adds a title to the graph, zooms out to see the entire graph and title more easily
